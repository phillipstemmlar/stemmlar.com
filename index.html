					My name is Phillip Schulze and I am a Computer Science Student studying at the University of Pretoria.
					I come from a town called Brits, it is in the North-West province in South-Africa. I speak two languages, 
					Afrikaans which is my home language and English.
					<br/><br/>
					I stay at the Repulic of Kollegetehuis, a residence at the 
					University of Pretoria. I am part of the Executive Council at Kollege where I have the role of being the 
					First Year Guardian for 2020. 
					<br/><br/>
					I really enjoy programming a lot as well and I would like to one day work in the Game Development Industry.
					I like learning new technology stacks inside and outside of University.
					<br/><br/>
					I have a Staffordshire Bull Terrier dog called Bessie. I love taking my dog for a walk and playing fetch with her.
					I have told her many tricks including the ability to wait before she eats until I say to her that she may eat.
					<br/><br/>
					I am an Afrikaner and thus unsurprisingly I love camping and having a braai. There are vry few things in life 
					that I enjoy more than sitting around a big camp fire with a bunch of friends and loved ones, having a few drinks and cooking a steak on the braai.
					<br/><br/>
					I enjoy playing rugby in my free time, this is something that I have been doing 
					for all of my life. I also enjoy plaing a video game called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with some of my friends.
					<br/><br/>
					I am a huge rugby watcher and an even bigger Blue Bulls supporter. When I was younger I prided myself on the ability to recite the starting line of all the South-African based rugby teams.
